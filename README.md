To create an effective README for your repository, I'll draft a structured template covering:

- Architecture Overview  
- Build & Run Instructions  
- CLI Commands for Tasks  
- Log Monitoring Instructions  

Please adjust any placeholders as needed to match your implementation.

# delhivery_assignment

## Architecture Overview

This project is primarily written in **Python** (99.1%), with some **CMake** (0.9%).  
It is structured to accomplish <provide a brief, one-sentence summary of the project's purpose, e.g., "automated package tracking and task handling for delivery services">.

### Project Structure
```

├── src/               # Main source code
│   ├── main.py        # Entry point
│   ├── tasks.py       # Task management
│   ├── monitor.py     # Log monitoring
│   └── ...            # Additional modules

├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
├── CMakeLists.txt     # CMake configuration (if needed)
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

### Components

- **Task Handler**: Manages and executes delivery-related tasks.
- **CLI Interface**: Provides command-line access to core functionality.
- **Monitoring Module**: Captures and outputs logs for observability.
- **Configuration**: Settings via environment variables or config files.

## Build & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- (Optional) CMake if building native extensions

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnd4i-aj/delhivery_assignment.git
cd delhivery_assignment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Or, if a CLI interface is present:

```bash
python src/main.py [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

---

## CLI Commands

Assuming `main.py` exposes commands via argparse/click/typer:

### Task Management

- **List Tasks**
  ```bash
  python src/main.py list-tasks
  ```
- **Add a Task**
  ```bash
  python src/main.py add-task --name "Deliver package" --priority high
  ```
- **Complete a Task**
  ```bash
  python src/main.py complete-task --id 42
  ```

### Monitoring & Logs

- **Tail Logs**
  ```bash
  python src/monitor.py --tail
  ```
- **Show Errors Only**
  ```bash
  python src/monitor.py --level error
  ```
- **Export Logs**
  ```bash
  python src/monitor.py --export logs.txt
  ```

---

## Monitoring Logs

Logs are generated in `logs/` or output to console by default.

- To view logs in real-time:
  ```bash
  tail -f logs/app.log
  ```
- To filter logs:
  ```bash
  grep ERROR logs/app.log
  ```

If using the built-in monitor:
```bash
python src/monitor.py --tail
```

---

## Notes

- Adjust CLI commands to match actual command signatures in your implementation.
- Refer to source code for available options and further customization.
